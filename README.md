### GA-NEWS - Social News App

Inspiration from Reddit.com

Users can create posts.
Users can vote.

Posts are voted on and high ranking posts move to the top.
Posts can be sorted by Top Voted or by Newest.

Unregistered guests can only view posts and see how many votes they have.




#####Extending the App

- Allow guests to vote once each post.
- Allow users to post videos which are then embedded in the post, to view on the website.
- Use AJAX to see the posts moving around in real time when they are voted on.
